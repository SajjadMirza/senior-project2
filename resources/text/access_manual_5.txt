The Pederson & Mirza A.N.I.M.E. rendering pipeline works in the following order:

    1. Prepare vertex array data, and then render it
    2. Vertex Processing:
        * Each vertex is acted upon by a Vertex Shader. Each vertex in the 
          stream is processed in turn into an output vertex.
        * Optional primitive tessellation stages.
        * Optional Geometry Shader primitive processing. The output is a 
          sequence of primitives.
    3. Vertex Post-Processing, the outputs of the last stage are adjusted or 
       shipped to different locations.
        * Transform Feedback happens here.
        * Primitive Clipping, the perspective divide, and the viewport transform 
          to window space.
    4. Primitive Assembly
    5. Scan conversion and primitive parameter interpolation, which generates a 
       number of Fragments.
    6. A Fragment Shader processes each fragment. Each fragment generates a 
       number of outputs.
    7. Per-Sample_Processing:
        * Scissor Test
        * Stencil Test
        * Depth Test
        * Blending
        * Logical Operation
        * Write Mask
        
A.N.I.M.E. stands for:
A - Asynchronous
N - Normalized
I - Independent
M - Matrix
E - Environment
