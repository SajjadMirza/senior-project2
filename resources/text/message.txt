Repeating employee message...

[TOP SECRET - FACILITY RESEARCH STAFF ONLY]

Just letting you all know about the presidential order for all non-american
employees in case you forget. Since detailed pictures cannot be displayed on 
these old terminals, I will do with basic descriptions.

Dwight D. Eisenhower - 1953-1961 - Holding glasses
John F. Kennedy      - 1961-1963 - Looking down
Lyndon B. Johnson    - 1963-1969 - Lapel Pin
Richard Nixon        - 1969-1974 - Holding paper
Gerald Ford          - 1974-1977 - Holding pipe

With this info, figuring out the root password should be a cake walk.

Your system admin,
Sajjad Mirza
