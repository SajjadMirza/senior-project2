Plants...

Notice to all personnel: please do not eat the mushrooms!

They are a specially modified Amanita phalloides and are highly toxic! They are
also NOT plants and I will be extremely cross with anyone who says otherwise! I
have been pursuing this research for over twenty-five years and cannot tolerate
such ridiculous notions as "mushrooms are actually plants".

- Professor Humphrey William Gerald Anderson Rogers XXIV.

P.S. WHO STOLE MY DONUT?!
